# Random-brain

Random brain is the neural network implementation of a random forest.

## Background on random forests
A random forest is a machine learning model that is composed of multiple decision trees. These trees in the forest all predict an outcome and the majority rules.

## Similarities
Just as the random forest is a vote based ML algorithm, the random brain is a vote based algorithm as well, but uses neural networks specified by the user rather than decision forests.

## Setting up Random brain
```
pip install random-brain
```

## API


## Disclaimer
The random brain module is in no way a production ready module. This is intended as a research experiment to easily implement random forest style forecasting for neural networks.
